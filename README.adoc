A Google Apps Script Hangouts Bot tutorial to *get data from an external api (http://numberapi.com/[https://numbersapi.com/, window="_blank"])* and setup a *development environment* with *version control*.

== Executive Summary

=== Introduction
Chatbots, or "bots" for short, are computer programs that interact with people in a way that mimics human interaction to some degree.  Bots in Hangouts Chat appear as special users marked as *BOT*.  Just like people, bots can participate in chat rooms, and they can respond to direct message.  But unlike people, bots only see messages directed to them when a person @mentions them in a chat room, or when a person sends them a direct message.

_Introduction summarized from the Hangouts Chat API - Chatbot Concepts.  To learn more, visit https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/concepts/bots[https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/concepts/bots, window="_blank"]._

=== Goals of the tutorial
This tutorial has the following goals:

* Create an Apps Script bot
* Setup a local development environment
* Connect the local environment to Github for version control
* Automatically push local changes to the Google Apps Script project on Google
* Code the bot to get data from the http://numberapi.com/[numbers api, window="_blank"]
* Deploy the chat bot for the following purposes:
** developer testing
** user acceptance testing
** production release

== Prerequisites and setup

=== Prerequisites

This article presumes a basic understanding of the following technologies:

_See the provided links per technology to refresh your working knowledge._

* JavaScript (https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript[Watch and Code - Practical JavaScript, window="_blank"])
* git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[Pro Git Book, window="_blank"])
* GSuite (https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/#!/[G Suite Learning Center,window="_blank"])
* Google Apps Script (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/[Google Apps Script Reference,window="_blank"])

This article requires the following:

. A GSuite account (see https://gsuite.google.com/faq/[G Suite FAQs, window="_blank"] for more details)
. Access to the Google Cloud Platform (https://console.cloud.google.com[https://console.cloud.google.com, window="_blank"])

=== Setup

==== Login to G Suite

. Navigate to *https://drive.google.com[Google Drive, window="_blank"]*
. Authenticate with your *G Suite credentials*

==== Create Google Apps Script File

Build web apps and automate tasks with Google Apps Script.  Apps Script is a rapid application development platform that makes it fast and easy to create business applications that integrate with G Suite. 
[NOTE]
See https://www.google.com/script/start/[Google Apps Script, window="_blank"] for more information.

. Click *https://script.google.com/create?template=hangoutsChat[Hangouts Chat Bot template, window="_blank"]* to create a Google boilerplate template.
. Click *File > Save*, name the project *'Numbers'*, and click *OK*
. Open the *Code.gs* file, and locate the *onMessage(event)* function
.. Replace this original text:
[source, javascript]
    var name = "";
    if (event.space.type == "DM") {
        name = "You";
    } else {
        name = event.user.displayName;
    }
    var message = name + " said \"" + event.message.text + "\"";

.. with the following:
[source, javascript]
    var message = "You just said: \"" + event.message.text + "\"";

.. so that the *onMessage(event)* function reads as follows:
[source, javascript]
    function onMessage(event) {
        var message = "You just said: \"" + event.message.text + "\"";
        return { "text": message };
    }

. Save the *Numbers* project, by executing the shortcut key stroke: *Ctrl + s*.

==== Setup Local Environment

. Open a *command line interface*
. Create a *new directory* on your computer to store your project and navigate into *the directory*:
[source, bash]
    mkdir Numbers && cd Numbers

==== Install clasp and clone project

Develop Apps Script projects locally using *clasp* (**C**ommand **L**ine **A**pps **S**cript **P**rojects). *clasp* allows you to check-in your code into source control, collaborate with other developers, and use your favorite tools to develop Apps Script.

[NOTE]
To learn more about clasp, see it's https://github.com/google/clasp[github repository, window="_blank"]

. Download *clasp*:
[source, bash]
    sudo npm i @google/clasp -g

. Enable the *Apps Script API*: https://script.google.com/home/usersettings[https://script.google.com/home/usersettings, window="_blank"]

. Login to *clasp*:
[source, bash]
    clasp login

. When prompted to login with a new window, Authenticate with your *G Suite credentials.*

. Within the Google Apps Script editor, click *File > Project properties* and copy the *Script ID* to clipboard.

. Using *clasp*, clone the *Google Apps Script project* with:
[source, bash]
    clasp clone <script id from clipboard>

==== Connect Remote Git repository

. Open a *command line interface*
. Navigate to the *Numbers* directory on your computer
. Execute the following command:
[source, bash]
    git init

. Create an account and/or sign in to *https://github.com[github]*
. Click on *Repositories*
. Click on *New* to create a new repository
. Enter a *Numbers* as the *Repository name*  and click *Create repository*
. Copy the  *first git command,* located in the *...or push an existing repository from command line*, to clipboard.
. Back in the *Numbers* directory, execute the copied command:
[source, bash]
    git remote add origin https://github.com/daubejb/Numbers.git

. To exclude the *.clasp.json* file from version control, execute:
[source, bash]
    echo '.clasp.json' >> ./.gitignore

. To stage the *files*, execute:
[source, bash]
    git add .

. To commit the *files*, execute:
[source, bash]
    git commit -am 'initial commit'

. To push the files to Github, execute:
[source, bash]
    git push -u origin master

==== Push changes to Apps Script Editor

. Prior to pushing changes to the Google Apps Script project, setup a *.claspignore* file.  This file operates similarly to a *.gitignore* file.  Create a file named, *.claspignore* with the following contents:
[source]
    **/**
    !Code.js
    !appsscript.json

. Execute the following command to push local code changes to the Google Apps Script project and editor:
[source, bash]
    clasp push

// JSON
// Include the query parameter json or set the HTTP header Content-Type to application/json to return the fact and associated meta-data as a JSON object, with the properties:
// text: A string of the fact text itself.
// found: Boolean of whether there was a fact for the requested number.
// number: The floating-point number that the fact pertains to. This may be useful for, eg. a /random request or notfound=floor. For a date fact, this is the 1-indexed day of a leap year (eg. 61 would be March 1st).
// type: String of the category of the returned fact.
// date (sometimes): A day of year associated with some year facts, as a string.
// year (sometimes): A year associated with some date facts, as a string.
// http://numbersapi.com/random/year?json
