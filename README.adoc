A Google Apps Script Hangouts Bot tutorial to *get data from an external api (http://numberapi.com/[https://numbersapi.com/, window="_blank"])* and setup a *development environment* with *version control*.

== Executive Summary

=== Introduction
Chatbots, or "bots" for short, are computer programs that interact with people in a way that mimics human interaction to some degree.  Bots in Hangouts Chat appear as special users marked as *BOT*.  Just like people, bots can participate in chat rooms, and they can respond to direct message.  But unlike people, bots only see messages directed to them when a person @mentions them in a chat room, or when a person sends them a direct message.

_Introduction summarized from the Hangouts Chat API - Chatbot Concepts.  To learn more, visit https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/concepts/bots[https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/concepts/bots, window="_blank"]._

=== Goals of the tutorial
This tutorial has the following goals:

* Create an Apps Script bot
* Setup a local development environment
* Connect the local environment to Github for version control
* Automatically push local changes to the Google Apps Script project on Google
* Code the bot to get data from the http://numberapi.com/[numbers api, window="_blank"]
* Deploy the chat bot for the following purposes:
** developer testing
** user acceptance testing
** production release

== Part One: Prerequisites and setup

=== Prerequisites

This article presumes a basic understanding of the following technologies:

_See the provided links per technology to refresh your working knowledge._

* JavaScript (https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript[Watch and Code - Practical JavaScript, window="_blank"])
* git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[Pro Git Book, window="_blank"])
* GSuite (https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/#!/[G Suite Learning Center,window="_blank"])
* Google Apps Script (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/[Google Apps Script Reference,window="_blank"])

This article requires the following:

. A GSuite account (see https://gsuite.google.com/faq/[G Suite FAQs, window="_blank"] for more details)
. Access to the Google Cloud Platform (https://console.cloud.google.com[https://console.cloud.google.com, window="_blank"])

=== Setup

==== Login to G Suite

. Navigate to *https://drive.google.com[Google Drive, window="_blank"]*
. Authenticate with your *G Suite credentials*

==== Create Google Apps Script File

Build web apps and automate tasks with Google Apps Script.  Apps Script is a rapid application development platform that makes it fast and easy to create business applications that integrate with G Suite. 
[NOTE]
See https://www.google.com/script/start/[Google Apps Script, window="_blank"] for more information.

. Click *https://script.google.com/create?template=hangoutsChat[Hangouts Chat Bot template, window="_blank"]* to create a Google boilerplate template.
. Click *File > Save*, name the project *'Numbers'*, and click *OK*
. Open the *Code.gs* file, and locate the *onMessage(event)* function
.. Replace this original text:
[source, javascript]
    var name = "";
    if (event.space.type == "DM") {
        name = "You";
    } else {
        name = event.user.displayName;
    }
    var message = name + " said \"" + event.message.text + "\"";

.. with the following:
[source, javascript]
    var message = "You just said: \"" + event.message.text + "\"";

.. so that the *onMessage(event)* function reads as follows:
[source, javascript]
    function onMessage(event) {
        var message = "You just said: \"" + event.message.text + "\"";
        return { "text": message };
    }

. Save the *Numbers* project, by executing the shortcut key stroke: *Ctrl + s*.

==== Setup Local Environment

. Open a *command line interface*
. Create a *new directory* on your computer to store your project and navigate into *the directory*:
[source, bash]
    mkdir Numbers && cd Numbers

==== Install clasp and clone project

Develop Apps Script projects locally using *clasp* (**C**ommand **L**ine **A**pps **S**cript **P**rojects). *clasp* allows you to check-in your code into source control, collaborate with other developers, and use your favorite tools to develop Apps Script.

[NOTE]
To learn more about clasp, see it's https://github.com/google/clasp[github repository, window="_blank"]

. Download *clasp*:
[source, bash]
    sudo npm i @google/clasp -g

. Enable the *Apps Script API*: https://script.google.com/home/usersettings[https://script.google.com/home/usersettings, window="_blank"]

. Login to *clasp*:
[source, bash]
    clasp login

. When prompted to login with a new window, Authenticate with your *G Suite credentials.*

. Within the Google Apps Script editor, click *File > Project properties* and copy the *Script ID* to clipboard.

. Using *clasp*, clone the *Google Apps Script project* with:
[source, bash]
    clasp clone <script id from clipboard>

==== Connect Remote Git repository

. Open a *command line interface*
. Navigate to the *Numbers* directory on your computer
. Execute the following command:
[source, bash]
    git init

. Create an account and/or sign in to *https://github.com[github]*
. Click on *Repositories*
. Click on *New* to create a new repository
. Enter a *Numbers* as the *Repository name*  and click *Create repository*
. Copy the  *first git command,* located in the *...or push an existing repository from command line*, to clipboard.
. Back in the *Numbers* directory, execute the copied command:
[source, bash]
    git remote add origin https://github.com/daubejb/Numbers.git

. To exclude the *.clasp.json* file from version control, execute:
[source, bash]
    echo '.clasp.json' >> ./.gitignore

. To stage the *files*, execute:
[source, bash]
    git add .

. To commit the *files*, execute:
[source, bash]
    git commit -am 'initial commit'

. To push the files to Github, execute:
[source, bash]
    git push -u origin master

==== Push changes to Apps Script Editor

. Prior to pushing changes to the Google Apps Script project, setup a *.claspignore* file.  This file operates similarly to a *.gitignore* file.  Create a file named, *.claspignore* with the following contents:
[source]
    **/**
    !Code.js
    !appsscript.json

. Execute the following command to push local code changes to the Google Apps Script project and editor:
[source, bash]
    clasp push

==== Deploy the bot for Development testing

===== Step one: Get the Deployment ID

. Open the *Numbers* file in Google Apps Script
[TIP]
To find the Numbers script in your https://drive.google.com[Google Drive], search for '*type:script*' and Drive will display all of your Google Apps Script projects +
 +
Or, navigate to https://script.google.com[https://script.google.com] to see all of your projects

. Click on *Publish* > *Deploy from manifest...*
. In the *Deployments* dialog box, next to *Latest Version (HEAD)*, click *Get ID*
. Within the *Deployment ID* dialog box, copy the value listed for *Deployment ID*
[NOTE]
You will need this *Deployment ID* in step two below
. Click *Close* and then click *Close* again to dismiss the dialog boxes
[TIP]
Use the *HEAD* deployment for development and simple unit testing.  Bots using the *HEAD* deployment cannot be shared across a domain and require users to have access to your *Google Apps Script*.
[NOTE]
See https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/how-tos/manage-releases[https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/how-tos/manage-releases] for more information about *Managing releases of your bot*

===== Step two: Configure the Hangouts Chat API on Google Cloud Console

. In the Script editor, click on *Resources* > *Cloud Platform Project...*
. Within the *Cloud Platform project dialog box*, click on the *Cloud Platform project* hyperlink that is associated with the project
[NOTE]
This step will open the *Google Cloud Platform*, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its en-user products, such as Google Search and You Tube.

. Within the *Google Cloud Platform*, enable the Hangouts Chat API by doing the following:
.. Click on the *navigation menu* and then click *APIs & Services > Library*
.. Start typing *Hangouts Chat API*, and then click on its associated *Card*
.. Within the *API Library overview page*, click on *ENABLE*
. Once the *API* is enabled, click on *Configuration*
. In the Configuration pane, configure the following:
.. Enter *'Numbers'* in the _Bot Name_ field
.. Enter *'https://goo.gl/yKKjbw'* in the _Avatar URL_ field
.. Enter *'Gets information about numbers'* in the _Description_ field
.. Check mark the *Bot works in direct messages* checkbox withing the _Functionality_ section
.. Select the *Apps Script project* radio button and paste the *Deployment ID* from _Step One_ above
.. Select the *Specific people and groups in your domain* and enter your G Suite *email address*
.. Click *SAVE*

===== Step three: Test the setup

. Navigate to https://chat.google.com[Hangouts Chat]
. Click on *Find people, rooms, bots*
. Within the *Add bot* page, search for *Numbers*
. Select the *Numbers* bot
. Withing the direct message, type '*Hello Numbers!*'
. If everything is setup correctly, you should see:

image::numbersSetup.png[title="Setup"]

// JSON
// Include the query parameter json or set the HTTP header Content-Type to application/json to return the fact and associated meta-data as a JSON object, with the properties:
// text: A string of the fact text itself.
// found: Boolean of whether there was a fact for the requested number.
// number: The floating-point number that the fact pertains to. This may be useful for, eg. a /random request or notfound=floor. For a date fact, this is the 1-indexed day of a leap year (eg. 61 would be March 1st).
// type: String of the category of the returned fact.
// date (sometimes): A day of year associated with some year facts, as a string.
// year (sometimes): A year associated with some date facts, as a string.
// http://numbersapi.com/random/year?json
// ⇒ {
//     "text": "2012 is the year that the century's second and last solar transit of Venus occurs on June 6.",
//     "found": true,
//     "number": 2012,
//     "type": "year",
//     "date": "June 6"
// }

== Part Two: Write, Lint, and Watch for code changes

Before writing code that retrieves information about numbers from (http://numberapi.com/[https://numbersapi.com/, window="_blank"]),  Let's improve the quality and standardization of the code through linting.

[NOTE]
A *linter* or *lint* refers to tools that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
 +
To learn more about the history of Linting, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)[Lint (Software) on wikipedia, window="_blank"]

[NOTE]
If not interested in setting up Linting, skip this step.

=== Setup ESLint within vsCode

[NOTE] This step assumes the use of Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/[https://code.visualstudio.com/].  Visit this link to download the code editor.

. Open the *Numbers* directory in *vsCode*
. Within *vsCode*, click *View > Terminal*
. Within *Terminal* execute the following:
[source, bash]
    sudo npm init

. Click *enter* to advance through the default selections
[NOTE]
*npm* is the package manager for the Node Javascript platform.  It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently.
 +
 To learn more about *npm* see: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm[https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm, window="_blank"]

. Click on *Extensions* in the *Activity Bar*
. In the *Extensions panel*, search for *ESLint*
. Select *ESLint* provided by *Dirk Baeumer*
. Within the *Extension: ESLint* informational page, click *Install*
. Open the *Command Palette* and select *ESLint: Create ESLint Configuration*
[TIP]
*ctrl + shift + p* - also opens the Command Palette

. This command launches *eslint --init*, provide the following answers to the init questions:
.. *How would you like to configure ESLint?* _Answer questions about your style_
.. *Which version of ECMAScript do you use?* _ES5_
.. *Where will your code run?* _Browser_
.. *Do you use CommonJS?* _No_
.. *Do you use JSX?* _No_
.. *What style of indentation do you use?* _Spaces_
.. *What quotes do you use for strings?* _Single_
.. *What line endings do you use?* _Unix_
.. *Do you require semicolons?* _Yes_
.. *What format do you want your config file to be in?* _JSON_
. Upon success, the *eslint --int* will create a local *.eslintrc.json* file

=== Resolve ESLint problems with current code base

. With only the *Code.js* file open within *vsCode*, within the *panel*, click on *PROBLEMS* to see the current [eslint] problems
[TIP]
*ctrl + j* will toggle visibility of the panel

. There will be approximately three types of lint problems listed, below is the summary and how to fix each type of lint error:

.ESLint Problems and Resolutions
|===
|Problem name |Resolution | Comments

|*Strings* must use single-quote
|Replace all *double-quotes(")* with *single-quotes(')*
|This is the project's developer preference

|Expected indentation of *'x'* but found *'y'*
|Make all *indentations* units of *'4'*
|This is the project's developer preference

|'functionName' is defined but never used
|Left click on each *instance*, then click on the *yellow light bulb icon* and select *suppress no-used-vars for this line*
|The three boiler-plate functions provided by Google's quick-start are only called from the chat.google.com application; so, this file 'thinks' they will never be called.
|===

=== Setup watching to automatically push changes to Google

*clasp* provides the ability to have your development environment watch for changes in code and automatically push the changes to *Google Apps Script* project.  And, since the Google Cloud Console Project is setup using the *HEAD deployment*, the changes will propagate to the live bot.

. Within *Terminal*, execute the following:
[source, bash]
    clasp push --watch
. When successful, the terminal will show:
[source, bash]
    Pushing files...
    --Code.js
    --appsscript.json
    Pushed 2 Files
    ࡫
. Within the *Code.js* file, make a simple change like adding the word *this*, within the *onMessage* function, at the end fo the "You just said *this*:" string
. Save the *Code.js* file
. Within the *chat.google.com* application, send the *Numbers* bot a direct message to see the *clasp* watch functionality publish the changes to Google and then automatically propagate the changes to the *HEAD Deployment* of the bot

== Part Three:  Implement chat logic to call Numbers API trivia

This part implements basic code to call the http://numbersapi.com[http://numbersapi.com, window="_blank"] for the user entered integer and then display the trivia fact for the number in the Direct Message or Chat Room.

1. With *clasp* watching changes to your local project, open *Code.gs*
2. Replace to content of your file with the following
[source, javascript]
----
include::/Code.js[]
----
